# What is TG.TestCaseApp?

TG.TestCaseApp is an application that lists products designed with microservice architecture by categories.

# How does it work
To run it, change the connection string in ProductService.Api and update your database. 
Then run the Web.ApiGateway and ProductService.Api projects at the same time with the Multiple startup project. 
You can then use the application by launching the Client application from the live server.
